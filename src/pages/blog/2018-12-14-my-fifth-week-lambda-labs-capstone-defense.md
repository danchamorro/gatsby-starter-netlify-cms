# Detailed Analysis

This week was our Capstone Defense. It was nerve recking to defend our app choice to our teachers. In the end, I think it went well. During the capstone defense, I was picked to do the presentation. I was nervous at first, but I was also excited. We were asked questions about why we choose our specific web stack, and what type of API's did we use. 

The final week wasn't too hard since we had a lot of the touch-up work done already. One big issue we ran into was that our deployment crashed literally four minutes before I needed to present our app. With the help of the team, we managed to troubleshoot the issue right as the meeting started. With our fingers crossed, I started the presentation. Specifically, saving the invoice was causing an issue. So I was on the edge of my seat as I approached that feature, and I know the rest of my team was as well. Then I hit save and boom, everything worked as expected. I could hear the sigh of relief in my head of all my teammates. 

As a team, we worked on creating our script for our app video. I also created the video to send to our video editor so we could make our video app. 

# Milestone Reflections

This week we all worked well with each other again. Lots of pair programming going on. No conflicts what so ever.
