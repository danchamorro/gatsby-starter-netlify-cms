# Detailed Analysis

One of the tasks that I choose to do was to set up the MongoDB Schemas. I decided this task because I never used MongoDB before and I wanted to learn more about it. My first order of business was to research MongoDB and understand how it works and how was I going to connect it Node. After a few hours of research, I felt ready. I learned that I would need a package called Mongoose. Installed Mongoose and now was time to build the schemas.

I started with the user Model because I knew it would have the least amount of fields.

### Invoice Model

# Testing the Models

In order to test the if the Models are working correctly I needed to see if I could insert data into the database. For this is used Postman and configured some POST routes.

# Milestone Reflections

Our team is awesome. Everyone has a good balance of front and back-end knowledge. We worked very well together. Those who were strong in one area help those who were weaker in certain areas, which for me was great because I was able to learn a few things from my teammates. We have yet to run into any friction. When deciding the stack we wanted to use, we listened to everyone's opinions and then collectively decided on the correct stack as a team.
